  "text": " Hey everyone, so now Barbea is one of the most in demand skills in 2025. And if I had start over, this is how exactly I'm going to do it to learn it fast. And if you are new here, welcome, my name is Barra and I've been leading big data and business intelligence projects over 10 years. And in my project, I have been using many different BI tools. One of them is Barbea. So now let's start from the top and understand what is exactly Barbea. And how in every company you have managers that ask critical business questions, which regions is underperforming and many other questions. And now in order to make smart decisions, they're going to ask you the data analysts to find the answers using data. And in order to do that, you need tools like Barbea. So now what you're going to do, you're going to go and connect their companies data to the Barbea high. And after that, you're going to go and start preparing the data for the analysis, like cleaning up the data during few calculations. And then after that, you're going to go and build the visuals. So you're going to go and build their reports and the dashboards. And once you have them, you're going to go and present the results to the managers as you are telling story behind the data. And with that, you are helping the managers to make quick, smart and bitter decisions for the business. So that means reuse Barbea in order to turn the raw and clean data into beautiful and easy to understand visuals that can help the managers to make bitter decisions. Okay, so now the next question is, what is inside Barbea? Well, we have five layers, all let's say five engines. Let's start with the first one. We have that baroque query. So now always the first task in Barbea is to connect our data. So use the baroque query in order to connect multiple source types, like databases, APIs, and files. And now this connected new data to Barbea is usually not clean. So in real projects, we cannot go and immediately like build visualizations on top of it. We have to clean the data first using Baroque query. So we can remove unnecessary columns, remove nulls, rename the columns, filter the rows, and many other stuff. So that means with this layer, we are connecting and cleaning up the data. Now once we have that, then we go to the next engine or layer. We call it the data modeling. Now that's your data is clean. It's time to organize it. So in this layer, you're going to go and build relationships between tables. You're going to try to build your star schema where you have in the middle your fact table and surrounded with multiple dimensions. This is very important in order to have fast dashboards and correct results. Once we have the data model, it's time to add now like brain or let's say intelligence to this model. And we use dacks in order to write formulas and calculations to create something new. So we need to create new columns, new majors that can help us to build the aggregations and the filters at the dashboard level. And this is really what is turning our data into answers. Now once we have all your calculations, we move to the fourth layer, we have the visualization. So now it's time to build the charts, the cards, tables, slicers and add some bookmarks, dread through and many other cool stuff. So we are building now the report or the dashboards that is telling a story. This is the only thing that the managers can see, everything else, all the other layers. They are just pre-steps in order to come to this phase. So your end users will not see the data model or the dacks and calculations, all those stuff are behind the scenes and your users can see only the dashboards and the charts. Now we're going to move to the sharing layer. So now it's time to publish and share our work with others. So we might go and share it for example in Power BI Premium. It's like Cloud Service from Power BI where the users can open their browser and access your dashboards. So this is the end-to-end process and the five layers that you go through in order to build professional dashboards in Power BI. And now you might ask me which course do I recommend? Well so far in my channel I have only tabloat, it is very similar that I've used to like Power BI. So that's why I went and started searching for resources and courses for a Power BI. And I found there is something nice in that account. And by the way this video is sponsored by that account. So thank you for that. Now I went deeper in the courses and what I really love is how the courses are interactive. So there are a lot of interactive exercises directly in your browser. You don't even need to install anything given Power BI. Everything is integrated in the platform, the Power BI, the data, the exercises which makes the whole learning experience smooth and interactive. Now first I'm going to recommend you to start with the Power BI fundamentals. It is perfect for beginners. You can learn their how to clean data, build dashboards and create clear visualizations step by step. Then in the next step I would go to the data analytics in Power BI. This one takes you deeper into data modeling, ducts, storytelling and all the techniques about dashboarding. So now with those two you can learn Power BI but of course what is missing is certifications. So that means if you want to get 3.35 you can get here 50% discounts. So now my friend after I went through the platform and the courses I thought you have the whole package. You have the theory, the interactive exercises and at the end you can get certified. Which is everything that I need if I want to start again with Power BI. So if you like it just use my links in the description. So now I'm going to show you the faces that I'm going to go through in order to lay Power BI. So the first face is all about to get yourself familiar with Power BI. So first you're going to go and download Power BI desktop. Then go and grab one very simple CSV file. I fill you few links for some resources in order to train. Of course everything I have prepared for you in the notion templates and then I want to skip all the layers and jump immediately to the visualization parts. So now just spend like an hour exploring the interface. Check what are the visuals that you have. Like go and drag and drop stuff you will not break anything. It is just a playground and just explore the features that you see in the interface. So after one hour I'm pretty sure that you will be building something like a buy, power or line charts. So it's all about to get a feel for it. It's like your first time driving a car. You don't have to learn a lot of theory about it. You are just moving. So as you can see in this face you are just focusing on the visualization layer. And the whole thing might not take more than one to two hours. Now moving on to the phase number two. Here we have to go and build some confidence where we're going to go and connect multiple files but still there are small files. And this time we're going to be focusing on two new layers. The data modeling and the ducks. So in the data modeling you have to start learning about something called Star schema and how to connect multiple tables and build relationships between them. They are multiple types on how to connect the tables and what are those relationships means for me in the dashboards. After you build, let's say your star schema then you start learning the basic functions in ducks. So you have to learn how to create columns, measures, filters. You don't have to master all the functions in ducks but you have to learn the basics. And as well you can keep of course practicing in the visualization layer. So this phase might take a week in order to understand how things work in the data modeling in barbie. But are the most important functions in ducks. Now moving on to the last phase, we're going to go deep and get you ready. So here it's time to experience real projects. So you're going to go and connect files with 1000 of rows and this time you have to learn about the power query. How to clean up the data, remove the nails and unwanted data. And after that again build a solid data model, Star schema and do the calculations that you need in order to answer the requirements that you have in this project. And after that you start building the visuals and charts that you want to present in the project and here you have to learn the advanced techniques like the bookmarks, the parameters, how to drill in the data. You have to make professional looking dashboards that is dynamic and interactive for the users. And as well very important, it answers the project requirements. Now you go in the project to the last phase where you're going to share your results. So for free, of course you can go always and share the barbie file or if you have already licensed like in Power BI Pro and if you have access to Power BI premium, you have to learn their few stuff like what is the difference between a report, dashboard and app, how to refresh your data and your data model and depend on your speed, this project might take like few weeks. And after that of course you are ready to apply for any job that requires Power BI. And they have lived for you in Ocean template with their complete roadmap on how to learn Power BI. So there you can see again the faces and with all the steps and the topics that you have to learn in each phase. And there you can find as well resources, links to the data, links to the courses. And as well you can go and track and plan your progress learning Power BI. So having a plan and a roadmap, it's always a nice thing in order to feel progress and to feel there is an achievements. Okay my friends, so this is how I would learn Power BI if I had start over in 2025. If you like this video and you want me to make more content like this, then subscribe, comment and like this can help the channel to grow and to reach the others. So thank you so much for watching and I will see you next time.",
